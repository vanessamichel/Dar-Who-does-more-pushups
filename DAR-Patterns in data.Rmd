# Introduction

Several years ago some MAT 111 students who were on the footbal team conducted a study of their team-mates.  The results are contained in the data frame `pushups` in the `tigerstats` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
data(pushups)
View(pushups)
help(pushups)
```

Among other things, the students recorded the type of position a player had on the team (either line or skill), and also the number of push-ups each player could perform in a two-minute period.

Line players are on the offensive or defensive line.  They need to be a certain kind of speed, but they must also be quite big and strong.  Skill players do a lot of runninga and catching:  they are the quarterback, running backs, receivers, etc.

Our Research Question is:

  >Who does more pushups, on average: a line player or a skill player?


# Methods
<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->






# Results
<!--You have both graphical and numerical methods, so you will have both graphical and numerical results to consider.!-->


## Graphical Results
<!--Your graph should have a good title, and axes should be labled as needed.  Discuss your graphical results, showing how they answer the research question.  Use specific features of the graph in your discussion.!-->


## Numerical Results
<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->


# Inferential Results
<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->


# Discussion and Conclusion
<!--State your overall conclusion.  This is also a good place to mention other Research Questions that came to mind as you were carrying out this study.!-->
